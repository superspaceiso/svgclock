# About
A small project to create a real time SVG analogue clock, it's not 100% SVG however as the clock hands are divs, but I may come back to this project at a later date.

This project also spawned an offshoot the [SVG Tool](https://github.com/superspaceiso/svgcircletool) using the formula provided by a friend to calculate the positions of shapes around the circumference of a circle.
